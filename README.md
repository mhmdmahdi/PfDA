# PfDA Project
The README need only contain an explanation
of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook.

This repository contains the jupyter notebook for this project. To run this simply select 'Cell' and 'Run All'. From here the project is broken down into 3 sections. 
    1. Selecting a data set
    2. Investigating the relationship of the variables wihtin the dataset to each other and to an outcome (a chosen index)
    3. Synthesizing/ simulating a dataset based on the chosen dataset - using a random generator
    
The repository also contains a project problem statement for reference.

Finally 2 .csv files used in the analysis are also available
    1. SuicideRates.csv - This is the chosen dataset for this project which the model was based on
    2. SuicideRates2016.csv - This is the test dataset for this project on which the accuracy was determined
