# PfDA Project
This repository contains the jupyter notebook for this project. To run this simply select 'Cell' and 'Run All'. From here the project is broken down into 3 sections. 
    1. Selecting a data set
    2. Investigating the relationship of the variables within the dataset to each other and to an outcome (a chosen index) using seaborn pairplot and barplot
    3. Synthesizing/ simulating a dataset based on the chosen dataset (using a random generator) and utilising the K Nearest Neighbors Classifier for predictions on another dataset where limited information is available based on a trained data set.  
    
The repository also contains a project problem statement for reference.

Finally 2 .csv files used in the analysis are also available
    1. SuicideRates.csv - This is the chosen dataset for this project which the model was based on
    2. SuicideRates2016.csv - This is the test dataset for this project on which the accuracy was determined
